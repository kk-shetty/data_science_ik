    "1. The dataset that we use to fit a model is called **training set**.\n",
    "2. An independent set used for model evaluation is called **test set**.\n",
    "3. A model can be negatively impacted if there are too many features.\n",
    "4. The data set that we use to fit a model can have some pattern + noise\n",
    "5. If we use more complex model to fit this training data more closely, we are likely fitting to noise in the data at some point.\n",

    "#### Summary:\n",
    "1. Careful EDA and FGeature engineering can improve accuracy and robustness of ML Models.\n",
    "2. Fitiing amodel to the training set is easy but fitting a model that performs equally well on unseen data is a key challenge.\n",
    "3. We need to be casefull in selecting the class of model and it's features that we use with models to avoid overfitting the model to training data.\n",
    "4. Overfitting occurs when we fit a model to noise in the training set.\n",
    "5. reserve some data for testing."
